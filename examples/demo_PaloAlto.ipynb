    "# Document retrival with custom embedding and agent \n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of document retrival development, vector embedding and agent play pivotal roles in capturing the essence of textual information as well as obtaining more timely information for better accuracy. At its core, <b>vector embedding</b> refers to the process of representing words, sentences, or even entire documents as dense, low-dimensional vectors in a mathematical space. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse representations like one-hot encoding, vector embeddings encapsulate the semantic relationships between words and enable algorithms to comprehend their contextual meaning. The mainidea of <b>agents</b> is to use an LLM to choose a sequence of actions to take. In chains, a sequence of actions is hardcoded (in code). In agents, a language model is used as a reasoning engine to determine which actions to take and in which order.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Vector embeddings</b> hold immense importance in the realm of large language model (LLM) applications. LLMs, such as GPT-3, BERT, or Transformer-based models, have gained significant attention and popularity due to their remarkable ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of LLMs hinges on their understanding of the semantic intricacies of natural language. This is where vector embeddings come into play. By utilizing vector embeddings, LLMs can leverage the rich semantic information embedded within textual data, enabling them to generate more sophisticated and context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector embeddings serve as a bridge between the raw textual input and the language modelâ€™s neural network. Instead of feeding the model with discrete words or characters, the embeddings provide a continuous representation that captures the meaning and context of the input. This allows LLMs to operate at a higher level of language understanding and produce more coherent and contextually appropriate outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of vector embeddings for LLMs extends beyond language generation. These embeddings also facilitate a range of downstream tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, text classification, and more. By incorporating pre-trained vector embeddings, LLMs can leverage the knowledge captured during the embedding training process, leading to improved performance on these tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, vector embeddings enable transfer learning and fine-tuning in LLMs. Pre-trained embeddings can be shared across different models or even different domains, providing a starting point for training models on specific tasks or datasets. This transfer of knowledge allows for faster training, improved generalization, and better performance on specialized tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile <b>agents</b> are responsible for deciding what step to take next. This is powered by a language model and a prompt. This prompt can include things like:\n",
    "\n",
    "The personality of the agent (useful for having it respond in a certain way)\n",
    "Background context for the agent (useful for giving it more context on the types of tasks it's being asked to do)\n",
    "Prompting strategies to invoke better reasoning (the most famous/widely used being ReAct)\n",

With many more \"rain days\" than other major American cities, Seattle has a well-earned reputation for frequent rain. In an average year, at least 0.01 inches (0.25 mm) of precipitation falls on 150 days, more than nearly all U.S. cities east of the Rocky Mountains. However, because it often has merely a light drizzle falling from the sky for many days, Seattle actually receives significantly less rainfall (or other precipitation) overall than many other U.S. cities like New York City, Miami, or Houston. Seattle is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 days.\\n\\n\\n== Demographics ==\\n\\nAccording to the 2012â€“2016 American Community Survey (ACS), the racial makeup of the city was 65.7% White Non-Hispanic, 16.9% Asian, 6.8% Black or African American, 6.6% Hispanic or Latino of any race, 0.4% Native American, 0.9% Pacific Islander, 0.2% other races, and 5.6% two or more races.\\nSeattle\\'s population historically has been predominantly white. The 2010 census showed that Seattle was one of the whitest big cities in the country, although its proportion of white residents has been gradually declining. In 1960, whites constituted 91.6% of the city\\'s population, while in 2010 they constituted 69.5%. According to the 2006â€“2008 American Community Survey, approximately 78.9% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Those who spoke Asian languages other than Indo-European languages made up 10.2% of the population, Spanish was spoken by 4.5% of the population, speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 3.9%, and speakers of other languages made up 2.5%.\\nSeattle\\'s foreign-born population grew 40% between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The Chinese population in the Seattle area has origins in mainland China, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. The earliest Chinese-Americans that came in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were almost entirely from Guangdong Province. The Seattle area is also home to a large Vietnamese population of more than 55,000 residents, as well as over 30,000 Somali immigrants. The Seattle-Tacoma area is also home to one of the largest Cambodian communities in the United States, numbering about 19,000 Cambodian Americans, and one of the largest Samoan communities in the mainland U.S., with over 15,000 people having Samoan ancestry. Additionally, the Seattle area had the highest percentage of self-identified mixed-race people of any large metropolitan area in the United States, according to the 2000 United States Census Bureau. According to a 2012 HistoryLink study, Seattle\\'s 98118 ZIP code (in the Columbia City neighborhood) was one of the most diverse ZIP Code Tabulation Areas in the United States.According to the ACS 1-year estimates, in 2018, the median income of a city household was $93,481, and the median income for a family was $130,656. 11.0% of the population and 6.6% of families were below the poverty line. Of people living in poverty, 11.4% were under the age of 18 and 10.9% were 65 or older.It is estimated that King County has 8,000 homeless people on any given night, and many of those live in Seattle. In September 2005, King County adopted a \"Ten-Year Plan to End Homelessness\", one of the near-term results of which is a shift of funding from homeless shelter beds to permanent housing.In recent years, the city has experienced steady population growth, and has been faced with the issue of accommodating more residents. In 2006, after growing by 4,000 citizens per year for the previous 16 years, regional planners expected the population of Seattle to grow by 200,000 people by 2040. However, former mayor Greg Nickels supported plans that would increase the population by 60%, or 350,000 people, by 2040 and worked on ways to accommodate this growth while keeping Seattle\\'s single-family housing zoning', start_char_idx=20190, end_char_idx=24153, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.20033009109683986)], metadata={'2c79fb7f-23d9-428a-b0b0-034ba4e443bb': {'id': 'San Francisco.txt'}, '84104d4c-3ee3-47cd-997e-c38d30f1a777': {'id': 'Seattle.txt'}})"

In total, 45% (342,693) of San Francisco\\'s population spoke a language at home other than English.\\n\\n\\n==== Ethnic clustering ====\\nSan Francisco has several prominent Chinese, Mexican, and Filipino neighborhoods including Chinatown and the Mission District. Research collected on the immigrant clusters in the city show that more than half of the Asian population in San Francisco is either Chinese-born (40.3%) or Philippine-born (13.1%), and of the Mexican population 21% were Mexican-born, meaning these are people who recently immigrated to the United States. Between the years of 1990 and 2000, the number of foreign-born residents increased from 33% to nearly 40%. During this same time period, the San Francisco metropolitan area received 850,000 immigrants, ranking third in the United States after Los Angeles and New York.\\n\\n\\n=== Education, households, and income ===\\nOf all major cities in the United States, San Francisco has the second-highest percentage of residents with a college degree, second only to Seattle. Over 44% of adults have a bachelor\\'s or higher degree.\\nSan Francisco had the highest rate at 7,031 per square mile, or over 344,000 total graduates in the city\\'s 46.7 square miles (121 km2).San Francisco has the highest estimated percentage of gay and lesbian individuals of any of the 50 largest U.S. cities, at 15%.\\nSan Francisco also has the highest percentage of same-sex households of any American county, with the Bay Area having a higher concentration than any other metropolitan area.San Francisco ranks third of American cities in median household income with a 2007 value of $65,519. Median family income is $81,136.\\nAn emigration of middle-class families has left the city with a lower proportion of children than any other large American city, with the dog population cited as exceeding the child population of 115,000, in 2018.\\nThe city\\'s poverty rate is 12%, lower than the national average.Homelessness has been a chronic problem for San Francisco since the early 1970s.\\nThe city is believed to have the highest number of homeless inhabitants per capita of any major U.S. city.There are 345,811 households in the city, out of which: 133,366 households (39%) were individuals, 109,437 (32%) were opposite-sex married couples, 63,577 (18%) had children under the age of 18 living in them, 21,677 (6%) were unmarried opposite-sex partnerships, and 10,384 (3%) were same-sex married couples or partnerships. The average household size was 2.26; the average family size was 3.11. 452,986 people (56%) lived in rental housing units, and 327,985 people (41%) lived in owner-occupied housing units.\\nThe median age of the city population is 38 years.\\nSan Francisco declared itself a sanctuary city in 1989, and city officials strengthened the stance in 2013 with its \\'Due Process for All\\' ordinance. The law declared local authorities could not hold immigrants for immigration offenses if they had no violent felonies on their records and did not currently face charges.\" The city issues a Resident ID Card regardless of the applicant\\'s immigration status.\\n\\n\\n=== Homelessness ===\\n\\nHomelessness in San Francisco emerged as a major issue in the late 20th century and remains a growing problem in modern times.8,035 homeless people were counted in San Francisco\\'s 2019 point-in-time street and shelter count. This was an increase of more than 17% over the 2017 count of 6,858 people. 5,180 of the people were living unsheltered on the streets and in parks. 26% of respondents in the 2019 count identified job loss as the primary cause of their homelessness, 18% cited alcohol or drug use, and 13% cited being', start_char_idx=40056, end_char_idx=43976, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.18485257108528141), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='5c9e3afb-f6f9-4e63-9daa-cdcd423f93dd', embedding=None, metadata={'id': 'San Francisco.txt'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=[], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=[], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='San Francisco.txt', node_type=None, metadata={'id': 'San Francisco.txt'}, hash='babdb38d27536d717d1df1645020bf404613855e9743dee188f51729c453bf64'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='52f58de8-22b9-43ff-8bca-7fb68172b177', node_type=None, metadata={'id': 'San Francisco.txt'}, hash='6f474b3379e803bd1d389c431fb339b777aa5b807929715e325035be2f8e801e'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='2c79fb7f-23d9-428a-b0b0-034ba4e443bb', node_type=None, metadata={'id': 'San Francisco.txt'}, hash='769aad524c78e6f82c63044897e030edcae1fed5706522662346972b8b75b515')}, hash='748a215d8554b4f18cd7ac339e49d686eff3fc21cd0e8c4f229cd23878bad2cf', text=\"CA Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region of 4.7 million people (13th most populous in the U.S.), and has served as its traditional demographic focal point. It is also part of the greater 14-county San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area, whose population is over 9.6 million, making it the fifth-largest in the United States as of 2018.\\n\\n\\n=== Race, ethnicity, religion, and languages ===\\nSan Francisco has a majority minority population, as non-Hispanic whites comprise less than half of the population, 41.9%, down from 92.5% in 1940. As of the 2020 census, the racial makeup and population of San Francisco included: 361,382 Whites (41.3%), 296,505 Asians (33.9%), 46,725 African Americans (5.3%), 86,233 Multiracial Americans (9.9%), 6,475 Native Americans and Alaska Natives (0.7%), 3,476 Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (0.4%) and 73,169 persons of other races (8.4%). There were 136,761 Hispanics or Latinos of any race (15.6%).\\nIn 2010, residents of Chinese ethnicity constituted the largest single ethnic minority group in San Francisco at 21% of the population; other large Asian groups include Filipinos (5%) and Vietnamese (2%), with Japanese, Koreans and many other Asian and Pacific Islander groups represented in the city. \\nThe population of Chinese ancestry is most heavily concentrated in Chinatown and the Sunset and Richmond Districts. Filipinos are most concentrated in SoMa and the Crocker-Amazon; the latter neighborhood shares a border with Daly City, which has one of the highest concentrations of Filipinos in North America. The Tenderloin District is home to a large portion of the city's Vietnamese population as well as businesses and restaurants, which is known as the city's Little Saigon.The principal Hispanic groups in the city were those of Mexican (7%) and Salvadoran (2%) ancestry. The Hispanic population is most heavily concentrated in the Mission District, Tenderloin District, and Excelsior District. The city's percentage of Hispanic residents is less than half of that of the state.\\nAfrican Americans constitute 6% of San Francisco's population, a percentage similar to that for California as a whole. The majority of the city's black population reside within the neighborhoods of Bayview-Hunters Point, Visitacion Valley, and the Fillmore District. There are smaller, yet sizeable Black communities in Diamond Heights, Glen Park, and Mission District.\\nThe city has long been home to a significant Jewish community, today Jewish Americans make up 10% (80,000) of the city's population as of 2018. The Jewish population of San Francisco is relatively young compared to many other major cities, and at 10% of the population, San Francisco has the third-largest Jewish community in terms of percentages after New York City, and Los Angeles, respectively. The Jewish community is one of the largest minority groups in the city and is scattered throughout the city, but the Richmond District is home to an ethnic enclave of mostly Russian Jews. The Fillmore District was formerly a mostly Jewish neighborhood from the 1920s until the 1970s, when many of its Jewish residents moved to other neighborhoods of the city as well as the suburbs of nearby Marin County.\\nAccording to a 2018 study by the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco, Jews make up 10% (80,000) of the city's population, making Judaism the second-largest religion in San Francisco after Christianity. A prior 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, the largest religious groupings in San Francisco's metropolitan area are Christians (48%), followed by those of no religion (35%), Hindus (5%), Jews (3%), Buddhists (2%), Muslims (1%) and a variety of other religions have smaller followings. According to the same study by the Pew Research Center, about 20% of residents in the area are Protestant, and 25% professing Roman Catholic beliefs.
