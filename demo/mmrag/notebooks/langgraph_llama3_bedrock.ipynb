    "# Building a RAG Agent with LangGraph, LLaMA3â€“70b/Claude-3, and Scaling with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore how to build an intelligent using agent, langgraph and Claude-3/LLaMA-3 from Amazon Bedrock. This advanced RAG agent integrates several cutting-edge ideas from recent research to enhance its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adaptive Routing (paper): Based on the Adaptive RAG paper, our agent intelligently routes questions to different retrieval approaches, leveraging the strengths of each method for optimal performance.\n",
    "* Fallback to Web Search (paper): Inspired by the Corrective RAG paper, our agent falls back to web search if the retrieved documents are not relevant, ensuring comprehensive coverage.\n",
    "* Self-Correction (paper): Incorporating concepts from the Self-RAG paper, our agent identifies and corrects hallucinations or incomplete answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use LangGraph to build complex, multi-step workflows that involve language models and other components. By combining these research ideas, our agent will provide accurate and informative responses to challenging queries.\n",
    "This blog post expands on the work presented in Langchain-ai's notebook, illustrating how you can scale with cloud processing power. We will port the original notebook to utilize Amazon Bedrock for LLM inference to scale our embedding and text generation capabilities. The choice of vector stores (local chromaDB) will remain unchanged, and we will discover how to scale this part in future blog posts."

Here, we describe a patient with succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) mutation and a dopamine-secreting carotid body PGL to highlight the potential importance of screening for dopamine excess in patients with suspected PGL.Case ReportWe report a 34-year-old patient who presented with cranial nerve palsy and was found to have a cerebellopontine PGL.

Although current guidelines do not recommend routine evaluation of the dopamine levels in patients at risk for PGL, dopamine-secreting PGLs are frequently locally invasive or metastatic.ConclusionScreening for dopamine excess in patients with a predisposition to PGL or with suspected PGL may aid in diagnosis and as a marker of successful treatment.Key words: paraganglioma, dopamine, SDHB mutation\\nHighlights\\nâ€¢Exclusively dopamine-secreting head and neck paragangliomas are extremely rareâ€¢Dopamine-secreting PGLs may be asymptomatic until they cause mass effectâ€¢Patients at risk for PGL may benefit from dopamine and metanephrine testing\\nClinical RelevanceExclusively dopamine-secreting head and neck paragangliomas (HNPGLs) are rare and often asymptomatic until they are large. Here, we present a case of a patient with a dopamine-secreting HNPGL and SDHB mutation, highlighting the need to consider dopamine testing in patients at risk for HNPGL.\\nIntroductionParagangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors arising from neural crest cells. The majority are located in the head and neck and are nonsecretory, with clinical presentation often incidental or associated with mass effect. Approximately 4% produce symptoms related to clinically significant catecholamine excess.1 Among hypersecretory PGLs, reports of exclusively dopamine-secreting PGLs are exceedingly rare in literature and often lack typical clinical symptoms. This presents a diagnostic challenge because these lesions can go undetected until they cause symptoms due to mass effect. Here, we present a case of an exclusively dopamine-secreting carotid body PGL associated with hereditary PGL-pheochromocytoma (PCC) syndrome. Of note, PGLs are divided by location and origin into adrenal PGLs (ie, PCC), sympathetic abdominal PGLs, sympathetic head and neck PGLs (HNPGLs), and parasympathetic HNPGLs. Because very few studies have provided separate data on sympathetic versus parasympathetic HNPGLs, we use the term HNPGL to encompass both subtypes unless stated otherwise.Case ReportA 34-year-old Caucasian man presented to an otolaryngologist with 1 year of hearing loss in the right ear and 6 months of hoarseness and dysphagia. Auditory function testing demonstrated moderately severe mixed hearing loss in the right ear. Laryngoscopy revealed right cranial nerve IX-XII neuropathy and complete right vocal cord paralysis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 3.7-cm right cerebellopontine mass infiltrating the right petrous bone, right internal auditory canal, and jugular foramen (Fig.\\xa01\\nA), and he was referred to endocrinology for suspicion of an invasive right cerebellopontine PGL.Open in a separate windowFig.\\xa01A, T1 coronal magnetic resonance imaging showing the patientâ€™s right cerebellopontine mass infiltrating the right petrous bone, right internal auditory canal, and jugular foramen. B, Gallium-68 DOTATATE positron emission tomography showing avidity of the right cerebellopontine mass and a right level II neck mass posterior to the carotid.The patientâ€™s medical history included plaque psoriasis, generalized anxiety, and bipolar disorder with posttraumatic stress disorder. He was chronically on methotrexate 10 mg weekly, risperidone 2 mg nightly, and lithium 900 mg twice daily. He had no symptoms of catecholamine excess including headache, palpitations, diaphoresis, or hypertension. He had a paternal grandfather with glioblastoma, and his father had a history of renal oncocytoma; however, he had no other personal or family history of endocrine disorders or malignancy. Social history was unremarkable.On laboratory evaluation, the levels of fractionated plasma and 24-hour fractionated urine epinephrine, norepinephrine, metanephrine, and normetanephrine were normal. The level of fractionated plasma dopamine and 24-hour urine dopamine were increased at 1487 pg/mL (normal, <48 pg/mL) and 1262 Î¼g/24 hours (normal, <510 Î¼g /24 hours), respectively (Table). All plasma catecholamines, including dopamine, were obtained under supine resting conditions.TablePlasma and Urinary Metanephrine and Catecholamine MeasurementsBiochemical testResultReference valueBefore surgery\\xa0Plasma fractionated metanephrines\\xa0Normetanephrine67.2 pg/mL<210.1 pg/mL\\xa0Metanephrine30.3 pg/mL<88 pg/mL\\xa0Plasma fractionated catecholamines\\xa0Norepinephrine445 pg/mL<874 pg/mL\\xa0Epinephrine41 pg/mL<62 pg/mL\\xa0Dopamine1487 pg/mL<48 pg/mL\\xa024-h urinary fractionated metanephrines\\xa0Normetanephrine652 Î¼g/24 h156-729 Î¼g/24 h\\xa0Metanephrine183 Î¼g/24 h58-276 Î¼g/24 h\\xa024-h urinary fractionated catecholamines\\xa0Norepinephrine89 Î¼g/24 h<135 Î¼g/24 h\\xa0Epinephrine19 Î¼g/24 h<20 Î¼g/24 h\\xa0Dopamine1262 Î¼g/24 h510 Î¼g/24 hAfter surgery\\xa0Plasma fractionated catecholamines\\xa0Norepinephrine551 pg/mL<874 pg/mL\\xa0Epinephrine<25 pg/mL<62 pg/mL\\xa0Dopaminea264 pg/mL<48 pg/mLOpen in a separate windowaAbnormal laboratory values are bolded.Follow-up computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show further neoplastic disease. Gallium-68 DOTATATE positron emission tomography revealed an avid 3.4\\xa0Ã— 2.6â€“cm right cerebellopontine mass and a separate focus of uptake at level II in the neck, posterior to the left carotid (Fig.\\xa01\\nB). The patient underwent surgical debulking with a right translabyrinthine and infratemporal fossa approach and right neck dissection with excisional biopsy of the neck mass. Debulking was limited by vascularity of the cerebellopontine mass and challenging hemostasis intraoperatively. The level II neck mass was fully excised from within the carotid sheath near the carotid bifurcation, and intraoperative frozen tissue analysis revealed a separate 0.8\\xa0Ã— 0.5â€“cm right carotid sheath PGL. Histopathologic examination of both masses showed nested eosinophilic cells with mild nuclear atypia and delicate spindled sustentacular cells at the periphery of tumor nests consistent with carotid sheath PGLs (Fig.\\xa02\\nA). Synaptophysin staining showed diffuse expression, and S100 staining highlighted peripheral sustentacular cells, supporting the morphologic impression of PGLs (Fig.\\xa02\\nB and C). He had a residual tumor of 3.2\\xa0Ã— 1.9\\xa0Ã— 1.9 cm on immediately postoperative MRI and subsequently initiated adjuvant radiation therapy. On MRI at 6 and 12 months after completion of radiation therapy, the sizes of the residual tumor decreased to 3.0\\xa0Ã— 1.7\\xa0Ã— 2.9 and 2.9\\xa0Ã— 1.6\\xa0Ã— 2.7 cm, respectively. The plasma fractionated dopamine level 3 months postoperatively was 264 pg/mL.Open in a separate windowFig.\\xa02A, Hematoxylin and eosinâ€“stained section of paraganglioma showing nests of bland tumor cells with round nuclei and abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm.

D, Staining for SDHB showed aberrant loss of expression within the tumor.Follow-up staining of the histopathologic specimen showed loss of succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB) expression, suggestive of a mutation in the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (Fig.\\xa02\\nD). Genetic testing through Invitae Genetics was positive for hereditary PGL-PCC syndrome, with a pathogenic variant in SDHB, delEX1. His father and sister subsequently tested positive for the same pathogenic variant of SDHB, although their results for MRI of the skull base through the pelvis as well as plasma metanephrine and 24-hour urine dopamine levels were normal.DiscussionCarotid body tumors comprise the majority of HNPGLs, accounting for up to 60% of cases with an estimated annual incidence of 1 in 30\\u2009000.2 HNPGLs are typically nonsecretory. Only approximately 4% produce symptoms related to clinically significant catecholamine excess, usually identified as norepinephrine and/or epinephrine.1 Reports of exclusively dopamine-secreting tumors in the literature are rare. Miyamoto et\\xa0al3 reported only 33 total cases of exclusively dopamine-secreting PCC and PGL to date, with 12 of these located within the head and neck.The diagnosis of an exclusively dopamine-secreting PGL is challenging. Patients usually do not have a clinically distinct presentation. In a 2005 case study by Eisenhofer et\\xa0al,4,5 3 of 9 patients with a biochemically documented dopamine-secreting PGL presented with nausea and vomiting, although the patient in this case did not have these symptoms. As in our case, symptoms are frequently associated with local mass effect or are found incidentally. The paroxysmal sweating, palpitations, headaches, and hypertension usually ascribed to the adrenergic effects of excess norepinephrine and epinephrine are absent, and patients are often normotensive.3,6 The diagnostic standard for biochemical evaluation of PGL is the measurement of norepinephrine and epinephrine metabolites in plasma and urine. The sensitivity rates of fractionated and urinary plasma metanephrines are near 100%7; however, dopamine excess is not routinely measured, and current guidelines do not recommend routine screening of urine and plasma dopamine.8 Dopamine-secreting PGLs often have delayed presentation, leading to larger tumors at discovery with greater metastatic potential. The rate of metastatic dopamine-secreting tumors is reportedly as high as 66% to 90%, significantly higher than the 21% to 29% in norepinephrine- and epinephrine-secreting tumors.9 On one hand, this suggests that routine measurement of dopamine in patients at risk for PGL could aid in earlier diagnosis. Van Der Horst-Schrivers et\\xa0al8 reported that 14% of patients with HNPGLs had increased urine dopamine levels without increased metanephrine levels. Given how rarely dopamine-secreting HNPGLs are diagnosed, this implies that a significant number of these tumors remain undiagnosed due to lack of testing. Conversely, dopamine measurements can be affected by environmental factors and inaccurate collection methods, increasing the risk of false-positive results.10 As current guidelines already recommend regular MRI screening of patients at genetic risk for PGL, the added benefit of dopamine screening remains unknown. Measurement of dopamine metabolites, such as methoxytyramine, may also improve detection of HNPGLs, although this was not tested in this patient.11Diagnosis in our patient was further complicated by first-generation antipsychotic use and the question of whether these dopamine antagonists could have increased the peripheral dopamine levels. To our knowledge, no available study has investigated the effects of antipsychotic drugs on peripheral dopamine. Boyda et\\xa0al12 showed no change in the peripheral dopamine levels in rats treated with low-dose risperidone and only a moderate increase with high-dose risperidone. Despite remaining on stable risperidone dosing throughout his course, our patient experienced an 82% postoperative reduction in the dopamine level. Thus, we presumed the significant excess of dopamine in our patient derived from a tumoral source. This suggests that serial dopamine measurements aid in monitoring patients treated for exclusively dopamine-secreting HNPGL.Definitive management of a PGL includes surgical resection, with radiation therapy for residual or nonresectable disease. In contrast to management of epinephrine- or norepinephrine-secreting PGL, perioperative adrenergic blockade can be withheld during resection of exclusively dopamine-secreting PGL because there is minimal risk of periprocedural hypertension and cardiovascular collapse.9 Definitive diagnosis of a PGL requires assessment of tissue histopathology; however, we are not aware of any reliable method of supporting the diagnosis of an exclusively dopamine-secreting tumor on histopathology.Immunostaining of tissue for SDHB does assist with identifying patients with hereditary PGL-PCC syndromes associated with germline mutations of succinate dehydrogenase. Sympathetic PGLs are most often familial and commonly associated with the SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. SDHB mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with incomplete and age-dependent penetrance. The predominant biochemical phenotype is hypersecretion of norepinephrine or dopamine, with only 10% of tumors exhibiting biochemical silence. This is in contrast to the previously discussed behavior of sporadic HNPGLs or HNPGLs without succinyl dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, which are rarely secretory. Importantly, those with SDHB mutations also have elevated chance of metastatic PGL compared with those with sporadic disease or other pathogenic SDH mutations, and screening for metastatic disease at time of presentation is recommended.4 Nonetheless, current international consensus guidelines do not recommend routine screening of the dopamine levels in patients with SDHB mutations.13ConclusionsExclusively dopamine-secreting PGLs remain an extremely rare clinical entity, with further rarity of those located within the head and neck. Although a guideline-based screening approach remains lacking, the increased risk of metastasis and the heritability associated with these tumors indicate the need for reassessment of current screening considerations. In a patient with presumed nonsecretory PGL based on normal norepinephrine and epinephrine metabolites or in the setting of a known SDH mutation, screening for dopamine hypersecretion could be considered to aid in diagnosis and monitoring.DisclosureThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by the National Institutes of Health', metadata={'language': 'en', 'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11127581/', 'title': 'Dopamine-Secreting Carotid Body Paraganglioma in a Patient With SDHB Mutation - PMC'}), -0.020275230124076504), (Document(page_content='AACE Clin Case Rep. 2024 May-Jun; 10(3): 109â€“112.

His father and sister subsequently tested positive for the same pathogenic variant of SDHB, although their results for MRI of the skull base through the pelvis as well as plasma metanephrine and 24-hour urine dopamine levels were normal.DiscussionCarotid body tumors comprise the majority of HNPGLs, accounting for up to 60% of cases with an estimated annual incidence of 1 in 30\\u2009000.2 HNPGLs are typically nonsecretory. Only approximately 4% produce symptoms related to clinically significant catecholamine excess, usually identified as norepinephrine and/or epinephrine.1 Reports of exclusively dopamine-secreting tumors in the literature are rare. Miyamoto et\\xa0al3 reported only 33 total cases of exclusively dopamine-secreting PCC and PGL to date, with 12 of these located within the head and neck.The diagnosis of an exclusively dopamine-secreting PGL is challenging. Patients usually do not have a clinically distinct presentation. In a 2005 case study by Eisenhofer et\\xa0al,4,5 3 of 9 patients with a biochemically documented dopamine-secreting PGL presented with nausea and vomiting, although the patient in this case did not have these symptoms. As in our case, symptoms are frequently associated with local mass effect or are found incidentally. The paroxysmal sweating, palpitations, headaches, and hypertension usually ascribed to the adrenergic effects of excess norepinephrine and epinephrine are absent, and patients are often normotensive.3,6 The diagnostic standard for biochemical evaluation of PGL is the measurement of norepinephrine and epinephrine metabolites in plasma and urine. The sensitivity rates of fractionated and urinary plasma metanephrines are near 100%7; however, dopamine excess is not routinely measured, and current guidelines do not recommend routine screening of urine and plasma dopamine.8 Dopamine-secreting PGLs often have delayed presentation, leading to larger tumors at discovery with greater metastatic potential. The rate of metastatic dopamine-secreting tumors is reportedly as high as 66% to 90%, significantly higher than the 21% to 29% in norepinephrine- and epinephrine-secreting tumors.9 On one hand, this suggests that routine measurement of dopamine in patients at risk for PGL could aid in earlier diagnosis. Van Der Horst-Schrivers et\\xa0al8 reported that 14% of patients with HNPGLs had increased urine dopamine levels without increased metanephrine levels. Given how rarely dopamine-secreting HNPGLs are diagnosed, this implies that a significant number of these tumors remain undiagnosed due to lack of testing. Conversely, dopamine measurements can be affected by environmental factors and inaccurate collection methods, increasing the risk of false-positive results.10 As current guidelines already recommend regular MRI screening of patients at genetic risk for PGL, the added benefit of dopamine screening remains unknown. Measurement of dopamine metabolites, such as methoxytyramine, may also improve detection of HNPGLs, although this was not tested in this patient.11Diagnosis in our patient was further complicated by first-generation antipsychotic use and the question of whether these dopamine antagonists could have increased the peripheral dopamine levels. To our knowledge, no available study has investigated the effects of antipsychotic drugs on peripheral dopamine. Boyda et\\xa0al12 showed no change in the peripheral dopamine levels in rats treated with low-dose risperidone and only a moderate increase with high-dose risperidone. Despite remaining on stable risperidone dosing throughout his course, our patient experienced an 82% postoperative reduction in the dopamine level. Thus, we presumed the significant excess of dopamine in our patient derived from a tumoral source. This suggests that serial dopamine measurements aid in monitoring patients treated for exclusively dopamine-secreting HNPGL.Definitive management of a PGL includes surgical resection, with radiation therapy for residual or nonresectable disease. In contrast to management of epinephrine- or norepinephrine-secreting PGL, perioperative adrenergic blockade can be withheld during resection of exclusively dopamine-secreting PGL because there is minimal risk of periprocedural hypertension and cardiovascular collapse.9 Definitive diagnosis of a PGL requires assessment of tissue histopathology; however, we are not aware of any reliable method of supporting the diagnosis of an exclusively dopamine-secreting tumor on histopathology.Immunostaining of tissue for SDHB does assist with identifying patients with hereditary PGL-PCC syndromes associated with germline mutations of succinate dehydrogenase. Sympathetic PGLs are most often familial and commonly associated with the SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. SDHB mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, with incomplete and age-dependent penetrance. The predominant biochemical phenotype is hypersecretion of norepinephrine or dopamine, with only 10% of tumors exhibiting biochemical silence. This is in contrast to the previously discussed behavior of sporadic HNPGLs or HNPGLs without succinyl dehydrogenase (SDH) mutations, which are rarely secretory. Importantly, those with SDHB mutations also have elevated chance of metastatic PGL compared with those with sporadic disease or other pathogenic SDH mutations, and screening for metastatic disease at time of presentation is recommended.4 Nonetheless, current international consensus guidelines do not recommend routine screening of the dopamine levels in patients with SDHB mutations.13ConclusionsExclusively dopamine-secreting PGLs remain an extremely rare clinical entity, with further rarity of those located within the head and neck. Although a guideline-based screening approach remains lacking, the increased risk of metastasis and the heritability associated with these tumors indicate the need for reassessment of current screening considerations. In a patient with presumed nonsecretory PGL based on normal norepinephrine and epinephrine metabolites or in the setting of a known SDH mutation, screening for dopamine hypersecretion could be considered to aid in diagnosis and monitoring.DisclosureThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.AcknowledgmentThis study was supported by the National Institutes of Health', metadata={'language': 'en', 'source': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11127581/', 'title': 'Dopamine-Secreting Carotid Body Paraganglioma in a Patient With SDHB Mutation - PMC'}), -0.020275230124076504), (Document(page_content='Copy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRESOURCES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Similar articles\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Cited by other articles\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                        Links to NCBI Databases\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJournal List\\n\\n\\nAACE Clin Case Rep\\n\\n\\nv.10(3); May-Jun 2024\\n\\n\\n                    PMC11127584\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n    As a library, NLM provides access to scientific literature.

The typical presentation is symptomatic hypercalcemia. Management of PHTP secondary to PTA requires excision of the adenoma.Case ReportA 13-year-old adolescent boy presented because of orbital cellulitis and was noted to have hypercalcemia. Despite this, the patient was curiously asymptomatic. Further investigations yielded an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and a normal urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio making the most likely cause of hypercalcemia PHTP secondary to PTA. Imaging demonstrated PTA. The patient underwent parathyroidectomy with the pathology demonstrating PTA. Postoperatively, the PTH levels were undetectable; hence, the patient was treated with calcitriol and calcium supplementation for 1 month and 4 months, respectively. Genetic work-up for multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 and rearranged during transfection mutations was negative.DiscussionSolitary PTA is the most common cause of PHPT. Adenomas are mostly sporadic or may be a manifestation of an inheritable syndrome, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia. Although symptomatic disease is more common in children, our patient denied any hypercalcemia symptoms. The distinguishing biochemical feature of PHPT because of PTA is high or inappropriately normal PTH level in the context of high-normal or elevated serum calcium levels. Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high. PTAs are localized by ultrasound and Tc-99m-Sestamibi scintigraphy. Management includes parathyroidectomy and monitoring for postoperative hypocalcemia.ConclusionIn a child or adolescent presenting with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, it is important to consider PHPT secondary to PTA, because an early diagnosis will aid in preventing complications from hypercalcemia.Key words: hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid adenoma\\nHighlights\\nâ€¢Although common in adults, primary hyperparathyroidism is a rare condition in children.â€¢The most common etiology of hyperparathyroidism in children or adolescent is single parathyroid adenoma.â€¢Primary hyperparathyroidism in pediatrics commonly presents as symptomatic hypercalcemia.â€¢The treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to adenoma is excision of the adenoma.\\nClinical RelevanceIn pediatric patients, primary hyperparathyroidism secondary to parathyroid adenoma is a rare condition. In a child or adolescent presenting with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, it is important to consider this condition as an early diagnosis, which will help prevent complications related to hypercalcemia.\\nIntroductionAlthough common in adults, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a rare condition in children or adolescents. The approximate incidence is 2 to 5 per 100 000 children.1 The most common etiology of PHPT in children or adolescents is solitary parathyroid adenoma (PTA) accounting for 70% to 80% of cases.2 In contrast to adults, in whom the most common presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic hypercalcemia, children and adolescents with PHPT are typically symptomatic.1 Excision of the PTA is the best treatment for children or adolescents with PHPT secondary to adenoma.3 Here, we present a pediatric patient with asymptomatic hypercalcemia subsequently found to have PTA on Tc-99m-Sestamibi scintigraphy and cured by parathyroidectomy.Case ReportA previously healthy 13-year-old African American adolescent boy was admitted for intravenous antibiotics due to left orbital cellulitis. He was noted to have elevated calcium levels (total calcium when corrected for albuminâ€”14.8 mg/dL and ionized calcium 6.73 mg/dL) on initial laboratory tests. Despite this, the patient was curiously asymptomatic and denied any constipation, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, polyuria, muscle weakness, or bone pain. The patientâ€™s mother denied any family history of hypercalcemia. The patient was born full-term with an uncomplicated birth history. Previously, the patient was noted to have an abnormal head shape, underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, and no further work-up was indicated. Other medical history included a diagnosis of attention-deficit or hyperactivity disorder. Medications included amphetamine or dextroamphetamine, guanfacine, and trazodone. In addition on presentation, the patient appeared well-hydrated with normal vital signs, moist mucous membranes, normal capillary refill, and normal skin turgor. This was further reflected by a normal blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine level. Repeat calcium levels remained elevated, which prompted further investigations. He was found to have elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH), elevated 1-25 hydroxyvitamin D, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and the random urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio was 0.15 for a calcium of 14.2 mg/dL (See Table). Because these laboratory test results revealed PHPT and normal urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio, the most likely cause of hypercalcemia was PTA. Thyroid ultrasound showed right PTA vs thyroid nodule, and Tc-99m-Sestamibi scintigraphy showed right PTA measuring 2.3\\xa0Ã— 0.8 cm (See Figs.\\xa01 and \\u200band2).2). The renal ultrasound was negative for nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.TableTimeline of Laboratory Values From Diagnosis to Postoperative Follow-upLaboratory valuesReference rangeAt diagnosisPost parathyroidectomy (3 mo after diagnosis)Last outpatient follow-up (8 mo after diagnosis)Calcium (mg/dL)8.5-10.114.29.29.9Phosphorus (mg/dL)3.3-5.42.63.54.6Parathyroid Hormone (pg/mL)13.8-85251.9<6.540.1BUN (mg/dL)7-1861412Creatinine (mg/dL)0.4-0.80.60.480.651,25-hydroxyvitamin D (pg/mL)19.9-79.3153Not availableNot available25-hydroxyvitamin D (pg/mL)>206Not available45Random urine calcium-to-creatinine ratio (inherently unitless)Not applicable0.15Not availableNot availableOpen in a separate windowAbbreviation: BUN\\xa0= blood urea nitrogen.Open in a separate windowFig.\\xa01Parathyroid or thyroid ultrasonography demonstrates a 0.9\\xa0Ã— 0.4\\xa0Ã— 0.6 cm isoechoic nodule inseparable from posterior or mid right thyroid lobe.

Pathology report demonstrated a PTA weighing 1.3 g. (See Fig.\\xa03). Postoperatively, the PTH levels were undetectable (See Table), so the patient was treated with calcitriol, calcium, and Vitamin D supplementation. Calcitriol was weaned off after 1 month, calcium supplementation was weaned off after 4 months, and the patient continues to take a maintenance dose of Vitamin D 1000 units daily. In addition, the patient was evaluated for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) with resultant genetic work-up negative for MEN1 and rearranged during transfection (RET) gene mutations.Open in a separate windowFig 3Hematoxylin and eosin stain of parathyroid adenoma at\\xa0Ã—200 magnification. Histopathologic findings include tissue that is densely cellular, richly vascularized, predominantly composed of chief cells with a few scattered oxyphil cells, and focally prominent anisonucleosis.DiscussionPTA is the most common cause of PHPT. PTAs are more common in women.2 The female-to-male ratio of PHPT is about 3-4:1.4 Interestingly, our patient is an adolescent boy. Adenomas are predominately sporadic or may be a component of a syndrome, such as MEN types 1, 2A, and 4; hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT); and familial isolated hyperparathyroidism syndromes.2 Primary hyperparathyroidism can also be due to CaSR mutation, such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, which are distinguished by decreased calcium excretion with resultant hypocalciuria.2 Genetic basis for PHPT occurs in approximately 10% of all patients with PHPT.5Although symptomatic disease is more common in children or adolescents, our patient denied any hypercalcemia symptoms. Symptomatic patients will experience symptoms, such as nephrolithiasis, polydipsia, polyuria, bone pain, muscle weakness, anorexia, nausea, constipation, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and difficulty with memory and concentration.The critical biochemical features of PHPT due to PTA are high or inappropriately normal PTH level in the context of a high-normal or elevated serum calcium level. Urinary calcium excretion is usually normal or high in contrast to familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia where it is characteristically low. The preoperative location of PTA is evaluated by neck ultrasound and Tc-99m-Sestamibi scintigraphy. The combined use of these imaging modalities for localization has demonstrated high sensitivities up to 94.5%.1 Once the PTA is localized by imaging, patients typically undergo parathyroidectomy. The cure rate and resolution of hypercalcemia symptoms after surgery is close to 97%.6 Postoperative hypocalcemia is a potential complication that needs to be monitored closely. In our case, the patientâ€™s PTH was undetectable after surgery, but the serum calcium level was not low. However, he was preemptively treated with calcium and calcitriol to prevent this complication.The use of molecular biology testing for germline or somatic mutations or de novo mutations of PHPT can be of clinical value. Germline mutations in the MEN1 (MEN1), RET (MEN2), and CDKN1B (MEN4) genes lead to multigland hyperplasia.7 By testing individuals for these mutations, it aids in establishing a diagnosis in a patient presenting with isolated PHPT, screening asymptomatic relatives of a known carrier, and allowing for earlier detection of tumors in patients who carry a mutation. Our patient was only tested for MEN1 and RET gene mutations of which he tested negative. Similarly, testing for mutations of the CDC73 gene yields a genetic diagnosis of HPT-JT in a patient presenting with PHPT and a suggestible history as well as allows for screening of asymptomatic relatives of a known carrier, which aids in early diagnosis and treatment of PHPT and malignancy. Finally, testing for mutations of the CaSR gene helps make a genetic diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. This can prove useful when a confirmed diagnosis is needed to avoid parathyroid surgery; however, a negative test does not exclude the diagnosis.5ConclusionAlthough PHPT is common in adults, it is a rare condition in pediatric patients. The most common cause of PHPT in children or adolescents is single PTA, so it is important to consider PTA in children or adolescents who present with hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels. Early diagnosis will help prevent complications related to hypercalcemia, such as arrhythmia, pancreatitis, and nephrolithiasis.DisclosureThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.AcknowledgmentPatientâ€™s guardian permission was obtained before the publishing of this manuscript.References1.

    "* Expand the Web Search Capabilities\n",
    "Currently, the web search capabilities only use the Tavily-AI Langchain tool, although Tavily AI has much more functionality to offer. You can, for example, include and exclude certain domains and websites, add the current date to target a specific timeframe of the results, and include a generic search on Google or DuckDuckGo to complement the Tavily-AI search.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Retrieve the topics dynamically\n",
    "We hard-code the topics represented in our knowledge base. If we know the topics ahead of time, this is a perfectly valid approach. However, for more fine-grained retrieval, we should consider including vector metadata in our vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change the knowledge base to a more scaleable option\n",
    "As the chromaDB vector store is running on our local instance, we have a scalability limit that is imposed upon us. We can use products like Pinecone or Amazon OpenSearch, just to name a few.\n",
