    "training and inference scripts and examples\n",
    "safe file format (safetensors)\n",
    "integrations with tools such as bitsandbytes (4-bit quantization) and PEFT (parameter efficient fine-tuning)\n",
    "utilities and helpers to run generation with the model\n",
    "mechanisms to export the models to deploy\n",
