This medication is for use only on the skin. Do not let neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination get into your eyes, nose, or mouth and do not swallow it. You may use neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin combination to treat minor skin injuries. However, you should not use this medication to treat deep cuts, puncture wounds, animal bites, serious burns, or any injuries that affect large areas of your body. You should call your doctor or get emergency medical help if you have these types of injuries. A different treatment may be needed. You should also stop using this medication and call your doctor if you use this medication to treat a minor skin injury and your symptoms do not go away within 1 week. Do not apply this medication to a child's diaper area, especially if the skin surface is broken or raw, unless told to do so by a doctor.

Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them.  However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet.
